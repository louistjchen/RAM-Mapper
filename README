Please read this file before compiling and launching the RAM Mapper.

Please follow the steps below to achieve successful compilation.
1)  Use <cd> to switch to the "assignment3" directory.
2)  Type <make> or <make all> to compile the source code.
    This will generate an executable called "RAM-Mapper".
3)  Type <make clean> if wish to clean the project.

Please follow the steps below to launch the application successfully.
4)  Use <pwd> to make sure current directory is "assignment3".
5)  To run the application, followings are multiple modes you can run.

    For LUTRAM + 1 type of RAM:
	./RAM-Mapper <logical_rams.txt> <logic_block_count.txt> <output_mapping_file.txt> \
		<RAM size> <RAM max width> <RAM logic block ratio> \
		-t -mjt

    For LUTRAM + 2 types of RAM
	./RAM-Mapper <logical_rams.txt> <logic_block_count.txt> <output_mapping_file.txt> \
		<RAM1 size> <RAM1 max width> <RAM1 logic block ratio> \
		<RAM2 size> <RAM2 max width> <RAM2 logic block ratio> \
		-t -mjt

    <-t> and <-mjt> are optional.
    If <-t> is specified, the application will output geometric average area.
    If <-mjt> is specified, the application will use MJT-based architecture instead of SRAM-based.

6)  For the default architecture (LUTRAM + M8KRAM + M128KRAM), the following
    is the command to generate mapping file that passes the checker.
    Mapping file for this architecture is included in the "results" folder called
    "mapping_file_default.txt"

	./RAM-Mapper <logical_rams.txt> <logic_block_count.txt> <output_mapping_file.txt> \
		8192 32 10 131072 128 300 -t

7)  For the best SRAM-based architecture, type the following command.
    Mapping file for this architecture is included in the "results" folder called
    "mapping_file_best_SRAM.txt"

	./RAM-Mapper <logical_rams.txt> <logic_block_count.txt> <output_mapping_file.txt> \
		4096 16 10 16384 16 20 -t

8)  For the best MJT-based architecture, type the following command.
    Mapping file for this architecture is included in the "results" folder called
    "mapping_file_best_MJT.txt"

	./RAM-Mapper <logical_rams.txt> <logic_block_count.txt> <output_mapping_file.txt> \
		4096 16 10 32768 16 20 -t -mjt

Hope you had a great time exploring my RAM Mapper program! :)
